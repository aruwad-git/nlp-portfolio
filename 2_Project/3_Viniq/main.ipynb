       "['When dining in a restaurant, a sommelier, or certified wine specialist, can assist you in selecting a perfect wine, even if you do not know much about wine yourself. By asking about your taste preferences, they can recommend a wine that pairs well with your meal, while complementing your likes and dislikes. But what happens when you’re browsing the shelves or web pages of seemingly endless choices of bottles, wondering how to select a good wine? For those who are not familiar with wine, the label on the bottle or product description — complete with descriptions of flavor notes, characteristics of the wine and origin of the grapes — may only make selecting a bottle even more difficult.',\n",
       " '\\nThe good news is, understanding some basic information about wine can help you learn more about which wines are likely to be a good fit for you — and which ones you’ll probably want to avoid. By learning about your tastes and the general characteristics of wine, you can become a wine expert in no time and feel confident in selecting a delectable wine to pair with your meal! You can also take our wine pairing quiz and find the perfect wine pairing for your next meal or upcoming special occasion!',\n",
       " '\\nChoosing a good wine is completely subjective. How each person defines a good wine is unique to them and their taste buds. Whether you prefer delicate, bold, sweet, tart or even spicy flavors, it is possible to find a wine you adore. These essential characteristics that define each variety of wine can be helpful to keep in mind as you navigate picking a bottle.',\n",
       " '• Sweetness: Wine labels often use the terms “sweet,” “semi-sweet” or “dry.” A dry wine will not be sweet at all.',\n",
       " '• Acidity: Wines with high acidity will be more tart, whereas low-acidity wines will taste rounder or richer.',\n",
       " '\\n• Tannin: Tannins are phenolic compounds in the skins of grapes. When tannins are naturally present in the winemaking process or added through aging, the wine will have a more bitter taste. Because tannins also tend to dry out your mouth, people often confuse the tannin level with the “dryness” of a wine, which actually refers to how sweet or not sweet a wine is. The red winemaking process incorporates more tannins, giving some red wines a distinctively dry and bitter finish.',\n",
       " '\\n• Body: Wines get characterized as having a light body, full body or somewhere in between. The “body” of the wine refers to how heavy or light it feels in your mouth. Generally, red wines have a fuller body than whites, as do wines made from grapes grown in warmer regions, rather than cooler ones.',\n",
       " '\\n• Alcohol: The higher the percentage of alcohol in your glass of wine, the more it will warm your throat and the back of your mouth. Measured in percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV), most wines contain 11 to 13 percent alcohol, but can range from 5.5 percent all the way up to 20 percent.',\n",
       " 'Everyone will have different preferences for each of these characteristics of wine, but with the right care, you can find a bottle that fulfills your taste preferences.',\n",
       " '\\nSince “good wine” is so subjective, knowing how to choose the right wine means considering several factors — including occasion, flavor preferences, labels and price points. While the combination of these factors is different for each person, the tips below will help anyone in search of that perfect bottle of wine.']"

      "# Question: Is price important for wine?\n",
      "-- No-RAG: The price of a wine is the most important factor in its value. The higher the price, the more money the wine will make.\n",
      "-- RAG: Because oak, time and terroir are the three main influences over a wine’s price, other traits could contribute to the final cost as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Question: How long can I consume a wine after purchase?\n",
      "-- No-RAG: The wine can be consumed within a year.\n",
      "-- RAG: Because: As a general rule, wines should be enjoyed within three to five days of opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Question: Are wines with screw caps bad?\n",
      "-- No-RAG: Screw caps are used to keep wine from leaking. Wines with screw caps are often made of plastic. Plastic is not good for the environment. The answer: no.\n",
      "-- RAG: Because Screw caps can get a bad reputation, they can still hold delicious wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Question: How can I log wine consumption?\n",
      "-- No-RAG: You can use a wine bottle opener to record your wine consumption.\n",
      "-- RAG: Because: The app Wine Ring allows new wine connoisseurs and veterans alike to learn a little something new about their taste profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Question: What should I check on the label of wine?\n",
      "-- No-RAG: The label should indicate the wine's vintage , the region of production , and the country of origin .\n",
      "-- RAG: Because: The amount of information the label has listed — does it seem like there’s quite a bit specific information about the region, valley and grapes? The general rule of thumb is the more details, the betterReading the wine bottle label is especially important for checking the alcohol content, as some white cooking wines have lower alcohol content than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Question: What is the most popular wine in Chile?\n",
      "-- No-RAG: Chilean wine is a type of red wine that is produced in the Andes region of South America. The most popular wine in Chile is Chardonnay .\n",
      "-- RAG: Because: Chilean wines have rightfully earned their place among the finest in the world\n",

However, if there’s ever a time to take a close look at the year on the bottle, it’s for red wines. If you’re looking for how to choose a good red wine and find yourself stuck between two different years of a variety, you may want to opt for the older Only a few types of wine benefit from aging — approximately 1% of wine is actually viable for long-term aging.
