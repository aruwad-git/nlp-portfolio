# Dear Recruiters, Fellow Data Scientists, <br>and Anyone Who May Be Interested

Hello!

I'm Keehoon, a Data Scientist specializing in NLP.

When I was a sophomore, I accidentally fell in love with AI. I started my research career at a lab in Yonsei University, one of the top universities in Korea.

After 5 years of academic experience earning my BS/MS degrees in Computer Science, I joined one of Korea's leading NLP companies. As a project manager and data scientist, I led a healthcare project on **Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems for Diabetes Management** for 4.5 years. It was an entirely new and thrilling experience to lead the project from scratch as a C-level manager, collaborating with a promising startup and top-tier colleagues!

During this time, I was deeply impressed by how NLP transforms groundbreaking AI research into real-world applications. After **substantial** effort in study and practice, I’ve built a solid NLP foundation and, as of January 2025, began actively preparing my portfolio and seeking new career opportunities.

With confidence built on a solid foundation in ML and NLP, and experience as an initial member of three startups, including a C-level position, I have actively begun preparing my portfolio and seeking new career opportunities as of 2025.

Please check out my portfolio below, <b><ins>which is actively updated</ins></b>, and don’t hesitate to reach out for recruitment, projects, or any opportunities we can discuss!<br>

Note: This is an informal version of CV for overview. If you want formal CV, feel free to contact me.
